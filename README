== Description

This class handles poker logic for 5 card poker hands.

Card representations can be passed to the PokerHand constructor as a string or an array.
Face cards (cards ten, jack, queen, king, and ace) can be created using their
value (10, 11, 12, 13, 14) or letter representation (T, J, Q, K, A)
