== Description

Ruby-Poker handles the logic for poker hands.

Card representations can be passed to the PokerHand constructor as a string or an array.
Face cards (cards ten, jack, queen, king, and ace) are created using their 
letter representation (T, J, Q, K, A).

== Examples

In this section some examples show what can be done with this class.

    hand1 = PokerHand.new("8H 9C TC JD QH")
    hand2 = PokerHand.new(["3D", "3C", "3S", "KD", "AH"])
    puts hand1                => 8h 9c Tc Jd Qh (Straight)
    puts hand1.just_cards     => 8h 9c Tc Jd Qh
    puts hand1.rank           => Straight
    puts hand2.just_cards     => 3d 3c 3s Kd Ah
    puts hand2.rank           => Three of a kind
    puts hand1 > hand2        => true

== Background

I (Robert Olson) wrote all of the code in the original version of ruby-poker which only
allowed for hands of 5 cards. I later discovered the amazing poker solving code written by
Patrick Hurley for [RubyQuiz #24]http://rubyquiz.com/quiz24.html and merged it into
ruby-poker 0.2.0.
